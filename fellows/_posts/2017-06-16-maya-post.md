Hi world! I'm a first year master student in Human Centered Design & Engineering here at UW. Generally I'm interested in leveraging technology to design products than enhance human abilities. Coming from a mixed background in Industrial Engineering and Human-centered Design, I'm also interested in designing systems that offer people a better environment to work and live.  
I'm very excited to be part of the Equity Modeler team in the DSSG program this summer. Always fascinated by the charm of cities, I'm hoping to build this tool that can help Seattle become a better place for all of us.
