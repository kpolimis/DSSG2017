My name is Daniel Dylewsky and I am a PhD candidate in physics and applied mathematics at the University of Washington. I grew up in Massachusetts and completed my undergraduate degree in physics at Georgetown University. My research involves data-driven analysis of complex dynamical systems. Recently I have been focusing on developing simulation-based models to describe the onset of instabilities in power grids.

I am looking forward to applying my background in networked systems and data analysis to the DSSG ORCA project this summer. I'm optimistic that the wealth of data that ORCA has supplied for this research will allow our team to produce some exciting results.
