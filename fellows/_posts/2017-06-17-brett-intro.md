Hello there everyone! My name is Brett Bejcek and I am a recent graduate of the Computational Data Analytics program at The Ohio State University. With past research experiences at The Cleveland Clinic, The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPMC), and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), I am experienced with real world applications of big data.Â

At The Cleveland Clinic, I utilized statistical methodology to conduct research on Lupus. While interning with NCES, I created paradata-based models in SAS to show how people interact in cognitive interview settings. I later presented the research to the US Census Bureau to provide new insight into standard protocol for cognitive interviews. At JPMC, I utilized SQL and R to analyze run-times of schemas in various data warehouse environments to optimize overall efficiency. Lastly, at PwC, I was a consultant in the Data and Analytics Technology field and provided a large telecommunications provider with insight into customer level viewership data.

This summer, I am working with my team to develop algorithms and quantify aggregated levels of vehicle traffic cruising. Our ultimate goal is to help reduce congestion in the downtown Seattle area. This project includes a wide variety of challenges and I am extremely excited to use creative thinking to propose new and innovative solutions. 

Outside of work, I enjoy getting out there and learning more about the world around me. If you have any projects that you would like to collaborate on or you would just like to chat about life, please feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brettbejcek/) or [email](mailto:bejcek.2@osu.edu). Cheers!
