I am a PhD candidate in Government at the University of Texas at Austin.
Most of my work involves applying statistical NLP tools to study formal
legal texts (e.g. national constitutions or ordinary legislation). I am
affiliated with the [Comparative Constitutions Project](http://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/),
and I helped to build [Constitute](https://www.constituteproject.org/).

With DSSG, I'll be working with the Vital Signs team on projects related to
food security, microeconomic indicators, and environmental outcomes in East
Africa. I'm excited to be involved with the project, and to build my skills
over the course of the summer.
